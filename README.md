# All you need to know about SPACE SNEK

<img width="900" alt="space snek" src="./images/the-game.png">

## Intro 

Become an astronaut and help the crew collect the stars!
The spaceship is going to move like a snake but it's not going to become longer after collecting stars. 
That's also why the game is called snek, not snake :)


## How to play

The user should use arrow keys to navigate the SNEK.

The user is going to collect items and after each collection the score will become bigger.

The goal is to collect 500 stars (which means collecting 50 items, 1 item = 10 stars).

The user must avoid collision with other spaceships and asteroids.

After collecting 350 stars, the arrows work the opposite way (when the user clicks right arrow, the snek will go right etc.).



Good luck, astronaut!
