# All you need to know about SPACE SNEK

<img width="900" alt="space snek" src="./images/the-game.png">

## Intro 

The user's spaceship is going to move like a snake but it's not going to become longer. That's also why the game is called snek, not snake.


## How to play

The user should use arrow keys to navigate the SNEK.

The user is going to collect items and after each collection the score will become bigger.

The goal is to collect 500 stars (which means collecting 50 items, 1 item = 10 stars).

After collecting 300 stars, there will be a change in colors so the user must adapt quickly.

After collecting 400 stars, the arrows work the opposite way (when the user clicks right arrow, the snek will go right etc.).

The user must avoid collision with other spaceships and asteroids.

Good luck, astronaut!
